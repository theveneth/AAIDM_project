How to declare your income

If you are not eligible for the automatic declaration this year, or if you are eligible and you need to correct or complete the information presented by the administration, you must file a declaration: do it online!

This declaration has been adapted to the implementation of the withholding tax and you can now find details of all your deductions and check them.

Check your pre-filled information

Whether you are filing an automatic return or a traditional return, you need to make sure that the information pre-filled by the authorities (taxable income and deductions at source) is correct.

To do this, use the annual summary that may appear on your pay slip or pension statement for December 2023 or on a specific document provided by your income providers.
If you do not have an annual summary, we suggest that you total up your taxable income and deductions at source from your pay slips for the year.

You can also find information about your deductions at source in your personal space under ‘Manage my deductions at source’.
Important note:

If you move house, check your address on 1 January on your tax return to avoid tax errors.
