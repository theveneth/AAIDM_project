The automatic declaration
 
For more than 10 years, the tax administration has been preparing your income tax return with information of which it is aware (family expenses, amount of wages, pensions, allowances, unemployment benefits, etc.).
 
Now, the automatic return is set up to simplify your life by allowing you, if possible, to no longer file your return, as long as the administration has all the information necessary to tax your income.
